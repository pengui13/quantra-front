# Security Policy

Quantra is an **educational** project. It is **not** a production exchange and must **never** custody, bridge, or process real funds. No security audit has been performed.

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are applied on the `main` branch only while the project is in active development.

## Scope & Non-Goals
- **In scope:** vulnerabilities that allow code execution, privilege escalation, unsafe account actions in the demo flows, or leakage of demo data.
- **Out of scope:** issues that require connecting to mainnet/real wallets, losses caused by using this repo with real value, or misconfiguration outside of the documented local setup.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open public issues for security problems.

1. Create a private security advisory on your forge (e.g., GitHub “Security Advisories”), **or**
2. Email the maintainer privately at **[dansklyarov13@gmail.com]** with:
   - Description and impact
   - Steps to reproduce / PoC
   - Affected commit or tag
   - Your desired credit (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and aim to provide a remediation or mitigation plan within **14 days** for valid issues.

## Coordinated Disclosure
Once a fix or mitigation is available, we’ll coordinate a disclosure timeline with you. Please avoid public disclosure until a fix is released.

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research. If you follow the guidelines above, we will not pursue legal action or request law enforcement investigation.
